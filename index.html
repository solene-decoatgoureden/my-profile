		<h1>Hello, I'm Solene :)</h1>

			I have three different hobbies. The first one is fashion, I've always liked going to fashion show. My second passion is food, I cook a lot but I also enjoyed very much tasting new flavors. Finally, I really enjoy going to theater but also pracitising it. It's something that helped me going through my shyness.

		<h2>ðŸ’Ž Fashion ðŸ’Ž</h2>
		    <p>
		    	I've always had a deep passion for fashion. It all started when I was a little kid, raiding my mother's closet and experimenting with her vintage treasures. Fashion is more than just clothing; it's a way to tell a story and to feel confident. My dream is to go one day at the Fashion's week in Paris or in Milan.

		<h2>ðŸŒ¯ Food ðŸŒ¯</h2>
		    <p>
		    	It all began when I was a kid, helping my mom and dad in the kitchen. My day is always better when I had a really good meal, it's like a tonic for me, it's comforting. I'm excited to keep cooking, tasting, and savoring every bite of every next meal and dinner.

		<h2>ðŸŽ­ Making Theater ðŸŽ­</h2>
		    <p>
		    	I practise theater for years now, and it had help on a lot of issues : shyness, sociability and confidence. I can really thanks my professor for helping me speak in front of a crowd. For me theater is not just about the acting; it's the whole process of bringing a story to life, from auditions to rehearsals and finally, the big performance.
